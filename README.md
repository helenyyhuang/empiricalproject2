# Empirical Project 2 - Do Smaller Classes Improve Test Scores? Evidence from a Regression Discontinuity Design
This repository contains my work on Empirical Project 2 from Prof. Raj Chetty's Big Data course, which is publicly accessible at [Opportunity Insights Course website](https://opportunityinsights.org/course/). The project focuses on understanding the impact of class size on student learning outcomes.

## Technologies Used
- STATA

## How to Use
1. Download the repository by clicking the 'Code' button and selecting 'Download ZIP' at the top right corner.
2. Extract the ZIP file on your computer.
3. Rename the folder after extracting it to ensure it is named `project2`.
4. Install Stata (if not already installed) to run the .do files.
5. Alternatively, view the `do.` and `.dta` files directly in the repository, or refer to the `empiricalproject2_helen.pdf` for a static representation of the responses and analysis.
6. For any queries or assistance, feel free to contact me at yhuan199@alumni.jh.edu.

## Usage
- `project2.docx`: Original assignment with detailed instructions and questions.
- `empiricalproject2_helen.docx` & `empiricalproject2_helen.pdf`: My detailed analysis and results.
- `grade5.dta`: The dataset used for the analysis.
- `empiricalproject2_helen.do`: A file containing Stata commands used in the analysis.
- `empiricalproject2_helen.log`: A log file recording the outputs from running the Stata commands.
- `figures_helen`: A folder containing exported figures from running the Stata commands.
- `BM_StandardError.R`: An file included in the original download package but is not utilized in this analysis.
